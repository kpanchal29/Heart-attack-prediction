This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of heart disease data using Python. Leveraging powerful data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the study aims to explore key patterns, trends, and relationships within a medical dataset related to heart disease indicators. The dataset includes critical features such as age, gender, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate, and other medical attributes that are commonly used to assess the risk of heart disease.
Through data cleaning, preprocessing, and the use of a diverse set of visualizations, this project highlights the most influential factors contributing to heart disease. Visual tools like bar charts, scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps, and line graphs are used to convey insights in a clear and accessible manner. These insights can aid medical professionals and data scientists in better understanding patient risk profiles and in developing early warning systems or decision support tools.
The project not only demonstrates the practical application of Python in healthcare data analytics but also emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making in improving patient outcomes. It serves as a foundational step toward more advanced predictive modeling and machine learning applications in the medical domain.
